# Sirius Roadmap: Key Research Findings

The Sirius Roadmap outlines a significant transformation towards modernizing testing and engineering practices. Key insights gathered include:

## Core Engineering Initiatives:
The roadmap mandates substantial engineering effort in several areas:

*   **Test Automation Tooling & Strategy:** Implementing Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with ReqNRoll and Playwright; developing robust PEGA API and unit testing capabilities.
*   **Test Data Mocking & Dependency Management:** Utilizing Mockito and MockFlow to create isolated and deterministic test environments, reducing flakiness from external dependencies.
*   **Environment Uplift & Management:** Dedicating DT2 for CI-driven automated tests and integrating performance profiling.
*   **Early Test Process Modernization (Shift-Left):** Embedding automation into CI/CD pipelines from early development stages, with developers owning unit and feature testing.
*   **Revamped UAT Approach:** Transitioning from manual UAT to an automation-first strategy with smaller, business-critical E2E automated packs providing evidence before UAT.
*   **AI-Powered Test Automation (Future Vision):** Exploring AI for test authoring, regression pack generation, mock creation, failed test analysis, and predictive risk assessment.

## Current Challenges Addressed by the Roadmap:

*   **UAT Inefficiencies:** Current UAT processes are heavily manual, leading to protracted 3-week cycles, late defect discovery, and reliance on risky manual Business Value Testing (BVT). The roadmap aims to drastically shorten UAT cycles and eliminate manual BVT through pre-UAT automation.
*   **Disconnected Engineering Practices:** Automation is currently not well-integrated into early development phases or CI/CD workflows. Test environments (DT1, DT2) suffer from instability due to shared access and real dependencies. There's a lack of a unit testing mandate. The roadmap proposes embedding automation across the pipeline, squad ownership of testing ("shift-left"), dedicated stable environments (DT2 with mocks), and a focus on unit testing.
