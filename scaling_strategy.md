# Strategy for Scaling Transformation via Pilot Team Rotation (Post 6 Months)

**Objective:** To systematically disseminate the new ways of working, engineering practices, and UAT automation methodologies established during the 6-month pilot phase to other teams, ensuring consistent adoption, continuous improvement, and successful program-wide transformation.

**Core Principle:** Leverage the experience and artifacts generated by the pilot teams and the two specialist engineers as a repeatable model for broader rollout.

## 1. Preparation for Scaling (During Pilot Months 5-6):

*   **Pilot Team & Specialist Engineers:**
    *   Finalize "UAT Automation Migration Playbook" and "Engineering Practice Playbooks."
    *   Refine training materials and workshop content.
    *   Identify "Practice Champions" within the pilot squads.
    *   Document key successes, challenges, and lessons learned.
    *   Establish a central repository for all playbooks, training materials, and assets.
*   **Program Leadership:**
    *   Identify the next wave of 2-3 "Adopter Teams."
    *   Communicate the scaling plan, objectives, and expectations to these teams.

## 2. Rotation & Embedding Model (Commencing Month 7+):

*   **"Seeding & Coaching" Model:** Key members (Practice Champions) from *enabled* pilot teams, along with support from the two central specialist engineers, will be temporarily embedded or assigned to mentor the new Adopter Teams.
*   **Role of Specialist Engineers:** Guide new teams in UAT automation setup and CI/CD/mocking practices, drawing on established playbooks. Provide overarching support and workshops.

## 3. Knowledge Transfer & Onboarding Mechanisms:

*   **Structured Workshops:** Kick-off workshops for Adopter Teams covering vision, tools, playbooks, and hands-on labs.
*   **Coaching & Mentoring:** Embedded champions and specialist engineers provide ongoing, on-the-job coaching.
*   **Pair Programming/Working:** Developers from Adopter Teams pair with experienced pilot team members or specialist engineers.
*   **Documentation & Resource Hub:** Full access to the central repository of playbooks, code examples, CI/CD templates, and FAQs.
*   **Communities of Practice (CoP):** Establish CoPs for Test Automation, CI/CD, and PEGA Development Best Practices for peer support and knowledge sharing.

## 4. Support and Governance for Scaled Teams:

*   **Central Enablement Team (Evolving):** The two specialist engineers form the nucleus of a growing central enablement/platform team.
*   **Regular Check-ins & Clinics:** Scheduled clinics and ad-hoc support channels.
*   **Quality Gates & Compliance Checks:** Lightweight governance to ensure adherence to core principles.

## 5. Feedback Loop & Continuous Improvement:

*   **Retrospectives:** Adopter Teams conduct regular retrospectives to identify improvements.
*   **Feedback to Central Team:** Formal mechanism for Adopter Teams and champions to provide feedback on playbooks, training, and tools.
*   **Playbook Evolution:** Central enablement team continuously updates playbooks based on feedback.

## 6. Measuring Success of Scaling:

*   Track adoption metrics for new teams (e.g., unit test coverage, CI/CD integration).
*   Monitor impact metrics (e.g., lead time, defect leakage rates, UAT cycle times).
*   Gather qualitative feedback from Adopter Teams.
